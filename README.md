</p>

The **JavaScript Laboratory (JSLAB)** is an open-source environment designed for scientific computing, data visualization, and various other computer operations. Inspired by *GNU Octave* and *Matlab*, `JSLAB` leverages the advantages of JavaScript, including its blazing speed, extensive examples, backing by some of the largest software companies globally, and the vast community of active programmers and software engineers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pr-dc.com/web/img/github/JSLAB_gui.png?v1" width="800">
</p>

The program was developed to fulfill the need for performing calculations in a programming language that allows for code reuse in later project stages. JavaScript was chosen for its speed, dynamic nature, interpretability, extensive library support, large existing codebase, backing by major software companies, and the ability to create both desktop and mobile applications.

`JSLAB` offers a streamlined, dual-window interface designed to boost productivity and foster innovation. The main window combines a versatile workspace with a sandbox terminal, allowing users to run, test, and iterate on code in real time. The dedicated editor window introduces the **.JSL file format**â€”a plain text format tailored for `JSLAB` scripts. With advanced linting and intelligent autocompletion, the editor makes it easy to write precise, reusable code with minimal errors.

## Getting Started

<details>

<summary>Click here to get started with JSLAB!</summary>

The image below shows the main window of the `JSLAB` program.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pr-dc.com/web/img/github/JSLAB_main_window.svg?v1" alt="Main window of the JSLAB program" width="800">
</p>

Within the main window, there are various shortcuts defined in the help windowâ€”for example, the `[CTRL] + [H]` shortcut opens the help window.

In the image above, the following elements of the main window are numbered:

1. **Main Window Header**  
   A menu with options for opening the code editor window, viewing help, accessing program information, and opening the program settings (such as language settings; currently, Serbian in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts and English are available).

2. **Workspace Navigation**  
   Icons for navigating through folders and opening a folder selection window. Besides the current workspace folder, you can save additional paths that will be used when running scripts.

3. **Command Window**  
   Located in the central right panel, this window displays messages from the workspace after code execution.

4. **Command Input Field**  
   Located at the bottom of the central right panel, this field is used to send commands to the workspace. As you type, suggestions for completing the command automatically appear based on the currently active workspace. You can also navigate through the history of entered commands. After typing a command and pressing `[ENTER]`, the command is executed in the workspace.

5. **Status Bar**  
   A bar at the bottom of the window displaying the current state of the workspace. In the bottom left corner, an icon changes color based on that state; clicking the icon displays a tooltip with information about what is currently active in the workspace.

6. **Command History**  
   Located in the lower part of the left central panel, this section allows you to track the sequence of executed commands and easily re-execute a command (by double-clicking on it).

7. **Workspace Variables**  
   In the central part of the left panel, this area displays the name, type, and class of each active global variable created by the user in the workspace.

8. **File Browser**  
   Located in the upper part of the left panel, this area shows folders and files, which can be directly opened within the editor.

> **Note:** The command window is ideal for entering a few commands. However, for more complex tasks, scripts are used.

---

## Editor Window

For `JSLAB` scripts, the `.jsl` extension is used to distinguish them from the standard `.js` extension for JavaScript. Scripts are executed by providing the script path as the sole argument to the `run` function. For writing or editing code in a script, it is best to use the built-in code editor (which can be opened with the `editor` command or the `edit()` function). The code editor window is shown in the image below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pr-dc.com/web/img/github/JSLAB_editor_window.svg?v1" alt="Code editor window of the JSLAB program" width="800">
</p>

In the image above, the following elements of the code editor window are numbered:

1. **Editor Window Header**  
   At the very top of the window, there is a menu with options for creating new scripts, opening existing ones, saving open scripts, and directly executing scripts in the workspace.

2. **Script Tabs**  
   Located just below the header, these tabs allow you to switch between the active scripts being edited and to open or close scripts.

3. **Script Text Editor**  
   This is the area where the script code is displayed. As you type, suggestions for completing commands automatically appear based on the currently active workspaceâ€”similar to the command window. This text editor provides many advanced features for working with code, including syntax checking, suggestions, the ability to collapse certain code blocks, and highlighting of the current active line.

The editor also includes additional advanced features for code input, such as searching through the code and performing text replacements (the search popup can be opened by pressing `[CTRL] + [F]`).

Most importantly, code can be executed in two ways:
- By entering commands in the command input field of the command window.
- By running a script using the `run()` function or directly from the editor window.
