Open-source JavaScript LABoratory environment for scientific computing,
data visualization, or any other operation on the computer. Inspired by 
GNU Octave and Matlab, but with all perks of JavaScript (blazing fast, 
with an incredible amount of examples available, developed by some of the 
largest software companies in the world, and with the largest number of 
active programmers and software engineers).
